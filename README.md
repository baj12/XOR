# XOR 

## Overview
Solving the XOR problem using deep learning (DL) and genetic algorithms (GA)

The purpose is to better understand how DL works, including neural network optimization using GA, network design, and many other. 
This is work in progress.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/baj12/XOR.git
    cd XOR
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    *** using conda ***
    ```zsh
    conda env create --file=environment.yml 
    conda activate xorProject
    ```

## Usage

Generate data

```sh
python src/data_generator.py
```
